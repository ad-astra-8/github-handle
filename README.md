This app is created as an assignment. We are using GitHub API to allow users to search for a GitHub user handle (username), and display the repos associated with that handle as a list.
For each repo, the repo name and link to the repo URL will also be displayed.
The dog API adress is https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories. 
The endpoint url is: https://api.github.com/users/username/repos.
